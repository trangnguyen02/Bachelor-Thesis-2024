# Bachelor-Thesis-2024

## 1. Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning algorithms on a telecom dataset. The aim is to identify at-risk customers before they leave, thereby reducing churn rates and improving customer retention.

## 2. Project Impact
By achieving an 85% accuracy on the test set, the model offers valuable insights that can potentially reduce churn by 10%, translating to significant savings for the company.

## 3. Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Machine Learning**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- **Evaluation**: Confusion matrix, AUC-ROC curve, F1-score
...

## 4. Data
- **Source**: Public dataset from Kaggle.
- **Size**: 7,043 customers, 20 features.
