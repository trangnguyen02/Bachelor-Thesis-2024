# Bachelor-Thesis-2024

## 1. Project Overview
Bachelor Thesis titled "Application of Behavior Scoring Techniques in Trade Credit Limit Adjustment"
This project focuses on building a model predicting customers' risk of turning delinquent within the next year, allowing credit risk analysts to make appropriate adjusments to their credit line. The project is executed in cooperation with Royal FrieslandCampina's Account Receivables Team.

## 2. Project Impact
The model offers valuable insights into the factors making a borrower profile risky. By demonstrating excellent perfomance in differenting between good and bad customers, the model shows the potential to reduce throughput time of a credit review by 25% and improve the consistency of the overall credit review system. 

## 3. Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Machine Learning**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- **Evaluation**: Confusion matrix, AUC-ROC curve, F1-score
